WASHINGTON — Senate Democratic leader withdrew the biggest gesture he had made to strike a deal: an offer to fully fund President Trump’s proposed wall at the Mexican border.

“The wall offer’s off the table,” the leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, told reporters at the Capitol a day after senators managed a 2.5 week Continuing Resolution. This is the third CR to date.

Congress has, historically, leveraged the risk of a government shutdown as a negotiation tool to achieve a bill to be signed by a president of the opposing party. Despite holding majorities in both the House and Senate, as well as the seat of the presidency, Republicans have, in a historical first given their control, failed to pass a budget. 

Schumer, however, was willing to put party differences aside in order to assure the fate of Dreamers. "During the meeting, in exchange for strong [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)] protections, I reluctantly put the border wall on the table for the discussion. Even that was not enough to entice the president to finish the deal," Schumer said from the Senate floor early Saturday.

While the president initially seemed interested, according to Schumer, he has now refused the agreement. (source: http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/370327-schumer-offer-on-border-wall-is-off-the-table)

Mr. Schumer’s decision to also renege now marks another turn in the debate over how to shield from deportation hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children — an expressed priority from the majority of both parties. Despite DACA itself previously carrying strong bipartisan support, President Trump repealed it by executive order in September. As a consequence of this action, and as part of a deal to end the shutdown, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised what he called a “fair and open” immigration debate on the Senate floor.

Just when that debate will happen, and what legislation will serve as its starting point, was unclear on Tuesday. The Trump administration has changed its position on Dreamers and has yet to clarify its contrasting statements. Several bipartisan groups have met in an attempt to address the fate of the young undocumented immigrants. Republicans are now claiming partisan recriminations on Schumer's part, while Schumer made clear that his offer was made in good faith that the GOP would accept and keep the government open. Trump and the Republican leadership  refused his offer Friday and have now blamed Schumer for being partisan in rescinding his offer today. It is common negotiation practice, however, to restructure a proposal after it has been rejected.

“If he wants a solution, that’s a step backward,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. The Times was unable to ascertain from Cornyn how many steps forward or backward the president took when he refused the offer Friday.

The White House has, again, unnecessarily muddied the conversation -- in this case by refusing to acknowledge the offer that Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle have confirmed.

“Senator Schumer is trying to rescind an offer that he never made in the first place, and misled the public about,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. The veracity of this statement, as with all statements from the White House, is dubious. Were it not an official statement from the White House, it would not be fit to print.

Roughly 800,000 young people brought to this country illegally have been protected from deportation under an Obama-era initiative, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. But Mr. Trump rescinded the program in September, giving Congress six months — until March 5 — to come up with a replacement.

Now the Senate has a new immigration deadline: Feb. 8, the date that a stopgap spending measure approved on Monday will expire. Mr. McConnell has said that if the fate of the young undocumented immigrants is not resolved by then, he will allow the floor debate on immigration.

“What came out of this mess was a date certain to move on immigration,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, a longtime advocate of an immigration overhaul who has been deeply involved in the bipartisan talks. “That’s positive. Whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican, we’re now moving on immigration. That wouldn’t have happened without this conflict.” It is unfortunate that a debate between the two parties was only possible after the Republican party failed to leverage its own political power to pass a budget.

[Seriously, Jon- look at the quote that Ted Cruz is given where he reports on what the Democrats want vs. I don't know, actually quoting a Democrat re: what they want themselves? I've redacted it, but this is just ridiculously partisan. You can see this straw man from space.]

Faithless charicatures of democratic party desires dominated debates in the House, where twice, in the Obama and George W. Bush presidencies, bipartisan comprehensive overhauls of the nation’s immigration laws have died. But senators, given the green light by their leaders, pressed ahead.

If nothing else, passage of a bipartisan immigration bill in the Senate would shift the political focus to the House, where the bulk of the 2018 election will be fought.

As lawmakers are racing to a conclusion, so are the courts. After a federal judge ruled that Mr. Trump could not summarily end the DACA program, the Justice Department appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said Tuesday that it would consider the case on an expedited basis, and ordered both sides to submit briefs by Feb. 2.

Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and five other senators of both parties proposed a measure that would have provided a path to citizenship for young unauthorized immigrants and would have met some of President Trump’s border security demands.

One outstanding question is what role Mr. Trump will play in any DACA negotiations; the president, per custom, remains unclear about what he wants, and senators have said that until he makes his wishes known, it will be difficult to reach an agreement.

According to the current climate of the debate the president and his allies on Capitol Hill will almost certainly reject any proposal that does not include funding for the “big, beautiful wall” that Mr. Trump promised to build along the southern border. It should not be lost on the reader that this is in direct contradition to his campaign promises that if elected, he would use his self-reported deal-making prowess to make Mexico pay for it. It is quite audacious that the administration would now choose to reject a congressionally wrought compromise if Democrats fail to support for an expenditure Trump promised the American people they'd never face. Sadly, this is a common problem of republican governance.

The administration has asked Congress for $18 billion to build the wall; Mr. Cornyn said that in negotiations with the White House before the shutdown, Mr. Schumer had offered the president $25 billion. A spokesman for Mr. Schumer declined to comment but did not dispute the figure.

Mr. Graham said he had a message for the administration. “To my friends at the White House: You’ve been all over the board,” he said. “You haven’t been a reliable partner, and the Senate is going to move. Please be constructive as we go forward. If you’ve got any ideas, let us know, but the Senate is going to lead on this issue.” This plea demonstrates the failure of leadership from the White House. Why it took a three day government shutdown to make this apparent to Republican leadership in the senate is compelling. Trump's unreliability is not a recent phenomenon.

The week before the shutdown, a bipartisan group of six senators led by Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Mr. Graham proposed a measure that would have provided a path to citizenship for DACA recipients, as well as more than $2.5 billion for border security and a grant of protected status for the parents of the Dreamers, who would be barred from sponsoring their parents for citizenship.

But Mr. Trump objected to that plan during a White House meeting in which he charictaristically used vulgar, insulting language to describe African immigrants. That rejection obviously set back the talks. Additionally, it further indicated that as much as it pains the editors of this paper to admit, the 45th president of the United States is unfit for office.

At the White House on Tuesday, Ms. Sanders underscored the administration’s opposition to the proposal. Further, from the briefing room podium, Ms. Sanders rejected it as a potential part of a framework for a new deal.

“It’s totally unacceptable to the president and should be declared dead on arrival,” she told reporters. Later, Ms. Sanders said at the same briefing that she did not think the sides were “that far apart.” An astute reader will recognize that the sides were indeed not "that far apart" at all given that they had negotiated an agreement which pleased both sides, prior to Trump's vulgar spike.

It bears repeating that the administration officially refuses to adopt a bipartisan plan that would meet the repeatedly expressed goals of both parties. What better deal does Mr. Trump, who (as is his custom) thus far has offered no specific agenda of his own, want? 

Editor's note: given the extraordinarily racist overtones of Trump's remarks when he disparaged the people of Africa and Haiti while praising Norway, it is not difficult to imagine that Trump's hardline position against the DACA negotiations are also racially motivated. We take accusations of racism extremely seriously here at the Times and offer this analysis in light of a lifetime of documented behavior, not least of all a judgment against his father's housing company (where he was a managing partner at the time) and his famous "birtherism" regarding former president Obama.

In light of the recent government shutdown and the inability of the republican party to either pass their own bill without democratic asistance or negotiate enough votes from the democratic party, however, it appears that the White House's appraisal of the two parties' nearness is perhaps a bit optimistic, especially without clear leadership. Lawmakers who have been working to resolve the DACA recipients’ status confessed that they did not know where they were headed. Asked what the next step would be, Mr. Durbin shrugged.

“I don’t know the answer,” he said. “I went to a meeting yesterday, a bipartisan meeting of senators, and we’ll see where it goes.”

While Mr. Durbin has suggested that the Durbin-Graham proposal should be the starting point for negotiations, Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has been a key participant in the bipartisan talks and has a history of bucking his party on immigration, said that would not be the case.

“We’ve negotiated a lot of these things,” Mr. Flake said. “We know where the contours are. But we’re not starting with any template.”

Talks that helped end the shutdown were led by a group of about 25 senators — Republicans, Democrats and an independent — who called themselves the Common Sense Coalition. They met in the office of Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.

Ms. Collins said Tuesday that while she did not intend for that group to pre-empt other efforts on immigration, its members “will be getting together to figure out if there’s a role for us to play.”

But any effort to pull the Senate to agreement on immigration will almost certainly be met with resistance from hard-line republicans, among them Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who said he was “already in the center of the immigration conversation.” Democrats have been unanimous and consistent in their position that a clean DACA bill would satisfy them. Since it is a faction of the Republican party and its president demanding additional concessions, any failure to reach a compromise will rest with them.
